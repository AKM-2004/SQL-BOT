# AI-Powered Natural Language Database Interface  

This project is an **AI-driven application** that allows users to interact with **SQL and NoSQL databases** using **natural language**. By leveraging **LangChain, LangGraph, and the ReAct method**, the system translates English commands into database-specific queries, making database management accessible to non-technical users.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview   
- **Supports SQL & NoSQL Databases** â€“ Works with multiple database types  
- **Web Interface with Streamlit** â€“ Easy-to-use UI for database interactions  
- **AI Agent with Logical Reasoning** â€“ Uses ReAct method for complex queries  
- **Deployed on Hugging Face** â€“ Accessible via a web interface  

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… Perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using English commands  
âœ… **Multi-database support** â€“ Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more  
âœ… **Step-by-step query execution** for handling complex requests  
âœ… **Secure credential input** via the Streamlit interface  
âœ… **Extensible architecture** for future database integrations  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **LangChain & LangGraph** â€“ AI-powered query generation  
- **ReAct Method** â€“ Logical reasoning for complex queries  
- **Streamlit** â€“ Web-based user interface  
- **SQL & NoSQL Databases** â€“ Works with various database types  
- **Hugging Face** â€“ Deployment for easy access
